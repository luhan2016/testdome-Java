Write a function that, given a list and a target sum, returns zero-based indices of any two distinct 
elements whose sum is equal to the target sum. If there are no such elements, the function should return null.

For example, findTwoSum(new int[] { 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 }, 12) should return a single dimensional array with two 
elements and contain any of the following pairs of indices:

1 and 4 (3 + 9 = 12)
2 and 3 (5 + 7 = 12)
3 and 2 (7 + 5 = 12)
4 and 1 (9 + 3 = 12)
